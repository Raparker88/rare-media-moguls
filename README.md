# Rare: Media-Moguls The Publishing Platform for the Discerning Writer
This app is designed for media junkies as a place to create, share and comment on content. Users can create posts with edit and delete functionality. Categories and tags can be created and associated with each post. The user is able to comment on posts and edit and delete comments that they authored. 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation
• From Github clone the ssh key using git clone

• The server side repo can be found [here](https:github.com/Raparker88/rare-API-media-moguls) with intstructions to install and run

## Utilities

In the `utils` directory, there is a **`HumanDate`** component that you can use anywhere in your application to display a human-friendly date instead of the unfriendly format that is stored in the API database.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
